This app offers the same functionality as the original WoonVeilig app, but can be used without a paid subscription.

NOTE: this app will connect directly to your WoonVeilig device on your local network. This device does not support a secure (HTTPS) connection. Be aware that the connection between Homey and your WoonVeilig device will be unsecured, but given that the connection is setup within your local network and does not go over the internet, this shouldn't be an issue for most users.
